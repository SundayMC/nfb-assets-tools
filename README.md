Not For Broadcast Assets Tools

Space needed in your disk :
When you going to use the script, extract the assets etc. The assets will be replicated three times. So, you need 120Go for the extraction and conversion to mkv and mp4.
But, at the end, you need 40Go with only mp4 files.

How to use:

1) Download https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio
2) Use AssetStudio to extract audio and video assets to "audio" and "video" folder
3) In the same folder than "audio" and "video", create "exportmkv" and "exportmp4"
4) After that, run the script with 1), then 2) and 3)

The first and the second step and the script can be make in 5/10 minutes, so you have to do this steps in one time. But, the third steps takes a few hours, so you can stop the third step and redo it at any moment without to redo all the files (makes sure to delete the last converted file when you stop the third step).

Use this assets for personal uses only.
