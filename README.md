Not For Broadcast Assets Tools

Space needed in your disk :
Video and audio files before execution (Function 1): 31GB
Mkv files (Function 2): 22.5GB
Mp4 files (Function 3) : 9.6GB

How to use:

1) Download https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio
2) Use AssetStudio to extract audio and video assets to "audio" and "video" folder
4) After that, run the script with 1), then 2) and 3)

The first and the second step of the script can be make in 10/15 minutes, so you have to do this steps in one time. But, the third steps takes a few hours, so you can stop the third step and redo it at any moment without to redo all the files (makes sure to delete the last converted file when you stop the third step).

Advice: Use this assets for personal uses only because NFB devs could be angered if you upload it.
